# byte_games - My first Golang adventure.
Playing with binary files.
* Included are both a script for creation and a script for reading the generated log.
* This was the first time I worked with golang, but it was seemingly the most accessible tool for the job.
* This was a lot of fun. 
* I haven't even thought about binary since 11th grade in '91. So bonus fun.
