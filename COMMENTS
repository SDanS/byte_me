# byte_games - My first Golang adventure.
Playing with binary files.
* Included are both a script for creation and a script for reading the generated log.
* This was the first time I worked with golang, but it was seemingly the most accessible tool for the job.
* This was a lot of fun. 
* I haven't even thought about binary since 11th grade in '91. So bonus fun.

# Building.
* Ensure that go is installed and properly configured. 
* Unzip files into your go project directory.
* From inside the directory, run:
>   go build .\readlog\readlog.go
>   go build .\createlog\createlog.go
* Run as demonstrated above or using help option.

The included README.md has further information on the scripts.
